In this section we introduce two important partial differential equations,
namely, the transport equation and the diffusion equation. We shall not deduce
them nor work out the solution to an initial value problem, but rather gain
physical intuition about the problem they model and the solution, as well as
discuss their relation to the convection--diffusion equations. The references
for this section are \cite{salsa2009pde} and \cite{evans1998pde}.

We will start by introducing some notation:
\begin{itemize}[topsep=0pt]
    \item A vector $\alpha = (\alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_n)$ such that $\alpha_1,
    \ldots, \alpha_n \geq 0$ is called a multiindex of order $\abs{\alpha} =
    \alpha_1 + \cdots + \alpha_n$.
    \item Given a multiindex $\alpha$ and a sufficiently differentiable function
    $u$, we define
    \begin{equation}
        D^\alpha u = 
        \frac{\partial^{\abs{\alpha}} u}{\partial x_1^{\alpha_1} \cdots \partial x_n^{\alpha_n}} =
        \partial_{x_1}^{\alpha_1} \cdots \partial_{x_n}^{\alpha_n} u
    \end{equation}
    \item If $k \in \z_{\geq 0}$, we denote by
    \begin{equation}
        D^k u(x) = \left\{ D^{\alpha} u(x) \mid \abs{\alpha} = k \right\}
    \end{equation}
    the set of all partial derivatives of order $k$. For $k = 1$ we have the
    gradient vector $D u = \grad{u} = \left(\partial_{x_1} u, \ldots,
    \partial_{x_n} u \right)^\top$ and for $k = 2$ we have the Hessian matrix,
    \begin{equation}
        D^2 u = 
        \begin{pmatrix}
            \partial_{x_1}^2 u & \cdots & \partial_{x_1} \partial_{x_n} u \\
            \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
            \partial_{x_n} \partial_{x_1} u & \cdots & \partial_{x_n}^2 u \\
        \end{pmatrix}
    \end{equation}
    \item The symbol $\Delta$ denotes Laplace's operator, \ie $\Delta u =
    \sum_{i=1}^n \partial_{x_i}^2 u$.
\end{itemize}

Informally, a partial differential equation (PDE) is an equation involving an
unknown multivariable function and its partial derivatives. Hereinafter, let $U$
be an open subset of $\real^n$,
