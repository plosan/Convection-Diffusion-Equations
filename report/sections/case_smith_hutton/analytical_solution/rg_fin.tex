\subsubsection{Solution for \texorpdfstring{$0 \leq \rho / \Gamma <
\infty$}{finite rho/Gamma quotient}}

Recall that for $0 \leq \rho / \Gamma < \infty$, problem
\eqref{eq:smith_hutton_cauchy_problem} is 
\begin{equation*}
	\left\{
	\begin{aligned}
		\Delta \phi - \frac{\rho}{\Gamma} \vb{v} \vdot \grad{\phi} &= 0 &
		&\text{in } \Omega \\
		\phi &= g & 
		&\text{on } C_1 \cup C_2 \\
		\phi_y &= 0 & 
		&\text{on } C_3
	\end{aligned}
	\right.
\end{equation*}
As in section \ref{sec:diagonal_Pe_fin_weak}, the PDE is second--order linear
elliptic equation, although in this case coefficients for $\phi_x$ and $\phi_y$
are not constant. On the boundary $\partial \Omega$ we have both Dirichlet and
Neumann boundary conditions. For this problem we cannot state any existence or
uniqueness result for classical or weak solutions, since we have both Dirichlet
and Neumann's boundary conditions on $\partial \Omega$, which implies we cannot
apply the theory already presented in section \ref{sec:diagonal_Pe_fin_weak}.
