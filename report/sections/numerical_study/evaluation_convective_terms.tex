\subsection{Evaluation of the convective terms}

The discretized version of the generalized convection--diffusion equation
requires the values of $\phi$ at points different from the nodes. In this
subsection we study several methods to compute the value of $\phi$ at faces. We
will assume that $\rho$ and $\Gamma$ are known at the nodal points. For the sake
of simplicity, we will evaluate the convective term at east face, although the
generalization to the remaining faces is straightforward. The references for
this subsection are \cite{patankar2008numerical} and
\cite{ferziger2002computational4finite}.
