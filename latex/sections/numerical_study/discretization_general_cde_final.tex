\subsection{Final form of the generalized convection--diffusion equation}

The purpose of this subsection is to obtain a discretization equation of the
form
\begin{equation} \label{eq:final_form_1}
	\mathcal{A}_P \phi_P + \sum_F \mathcal{A}_F \phi_F = \mathcal{Q}_P
\end{equation}
so that it can be easily implemented to be solved numerically, starting from
equation \eqref{eq:general_cde_discretized_implicit} and the studied schemes to
evaluate convective properties. Among the revised schemes, some use only the
surrounding nodes, whilst others involve a larger amount of nodes. As a
consequence of the different treatment needed, separate subsections are devoted
to each type of scheme.
