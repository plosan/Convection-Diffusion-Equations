\subsection{Assumptions}

In order to solve the convection--diffusion equations numerically, we must make some assumptions which will simplify our study.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item The location where the problem takes place is a closed connected set $K$ contained in a bounded open connected set $\Omega \subset \real^m$, where $m = 1, 2, 3$ depends on the dimension of the problem. Both $K$ and $\Omega$ are $\mathcal{C}^1$ or Lipschitz domains, allowing us to use vector calculus theorems.
	\item The problem lasts for finite time, starting at time $t = 0$ and ending at time $t = t_\text{max}$. Therefore the time interval is $I = (0, t_\text{max}) \subset \real$.
	\item The closed connected set $K$ can be expressed as the union of finitely many closed sets $\mathcal{V}_1, \ldots, \mathcal{V}_r$, that is, $K = \mathcal{V}_1 \cup \cdots \cup \mathcal{V}_r$. Moreover, these sets

The control volume centered at node $P$ will be denoted by $\mathcal{V}_P$. Its boundary, known as the control surface, will be expressed as $\mathcal{S}_P = \partial \mathcal{V}_P$. The volume $\mathcal{V}_P$ occupies in $\real^m$
