In this appendix we present two algorithms to solve linear systems.

Let $\mathcal{M}_{n \times n}(\real)$ be the space of $n \times n$ matrices with
real coefficients. We consider linear systems of the form $A x = b$, where $A
\in \mathcal{M}_{n \times n}(\real)$ is the system matrix with $\det(A) \neq 0$
and $b \in \real^n$ is the vector of independent terms. 

\subsection{Iterative method: Gauss--Seidel's algorithm}

Consider the linear system $A x = b$. A possible method to solve a linear system
is to generate a sequence $\{ x^{(k)} \}_{k \geq 0} \subset \real^n$ such that
$\lim_{k \to \infty} x^{(k)} = x$.  

\begin{theorem}
    If $A$ is a positive definite symmetric matrix or it is strictly diagonally
    dominant by rows, then the Gauss--Seidel converges to the linear system
    solution.
\end{theorem}
