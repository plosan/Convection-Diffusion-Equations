\section{Calculus and vector calculus}

In this appendix we gather some well known results on calculus and vector
calculus so that results on sections
\ref{sec:the_convection_diffusion_equations} and \ref{sec:numerical_study} are
well founded.

\begin{theorem}[Taylor's theorem]
	
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}[Divergence theorem]
	
\end{theorem}
