In this appendix we gather some well known results on calculus and vector
calculus so that results on sections
\ref{sec:the_convection_diffusion_equations} and \ref{sec:numerical_study} are
well founded.

Let $I \subset \real$ be a non--empty open interval and let $f \colon I \subset
\real \to \real$ be a $n$ times continuously differentiable function, \ie $f \in
\mathcal{C}^n(I)$. We would like to approximate the function $f$ around a point
$x_0 \in I$ with a polynomial of degree $n$,
\begin{equation} \label{eq:taylor_polynomial_1}
    P_n(x) = c_0 + c_1 (x - x_0) + \cdots + c_n (x - x_0)^n
\end{equation}
It seems reasonable that by imposing $P_n^{(k)}(x_0) = f^{(k)}(x_0)$ for $0 \leq
k \leq n$, the polynomial would be a good approximation of $f$ in a
neighbourhood of $x_0$. Thereby,
\begin{equation}
    \left\{
        \begin{aligned}
            P_n(x_0) &= c_0 = f(x_0) \\
            P_n'(x_0) &= c_1 = f'(x_0) \\
            &\vdots \\
            P_n^{(n)}(x_0) &= c_n n! = f^{(n)}(x_0)
         \end{aligned}
    \right.
\end{equation}
thus the coefficient $c_k$ is given by
\begin{equation}
    c_k = \frac{f^{(k)}(x_0)}{k!}
\end{equation}
and the polynomial \eqref{eq:taylor_polynomial_1} is
\begin{equation} \label{eq:taylor_polynomial_2}
    P_n(x;x_0) = 
    \sum_{k=0}^n \frac{f^{(k)}(x_0)}{k!} (x - x_0)^k = 
    f(x_0) + f'(x_0) (x - x_0) + \cdots + \frac{f^{(n)}(x_0)}{n!} (x - x_0)
\end{equation}

\begin{definition}
    The polynomial given by \eqref{eq:taylor_polynomial_2} is the Taylor
    polynomial of order $k$ of $f$ at $x_0$.
\end{definition}
