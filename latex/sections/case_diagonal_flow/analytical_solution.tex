\subsection{Analytical solution}

As we have previously seen, PÃ©clet's number is defined as
\begin{equation*}
	\peclet = 
	\frac{\text{convection transport rate}}{\text{diffusion transport rate}} = 
	\frac{\rho v_0 L}{\Gamma}
\end{equation*}
Note that the factor $\beta$ in the PDE from problem
\eqref{eq:diagonal_case_cauchy_problem} is a constant determined by the
geometry, whereas Peclet's number depends on the fluid and on the velocity
field. Since no more factors intervene on the PDE, this tells us that the
behaviour of the solution will depend greatly on Peclet's number.
