\label{sec:the_convection_diffusion_equations}

In this section we derive the continuity equation and the general convection--diffusion
equation. To begin, we present and prove Reynolds Transport Theorem, which
is a generalization of Leibniz integral rule. Next we deduce the aforementioned
equations using this theorem.
