\section{The convection--diffusion equations}

In this section, a rigorous derivation of the convection--diffusion equations is done. To begin, Reynolds transport theorem is presented as a generalization of Leibniz integral rule and is proved. Next, the distinct conservation laws are derived. Finally a common structure on convection--diffusion equations, which will ease their numeric study, is found.
