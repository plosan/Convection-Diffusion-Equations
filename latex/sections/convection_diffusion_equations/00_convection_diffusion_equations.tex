In this section we perform a rigorous derivation of the convection--diffusion equations. To begin, Reynolds transport theorem is presented as a generalization of Leibniz integral rule and is proved. Next, we derive the distinct conservation laws. Finally we find a common structure on convection--diffusion equations which will ease their numerical study.
