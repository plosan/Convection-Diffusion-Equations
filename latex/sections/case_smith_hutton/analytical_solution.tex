\subsection{Analytical solution}

Unlike the diagonal case, in the Smith--Hutton problem there is no clear choice
for a fluid velocity to compute PÃ©clet's number. The average velocity of the
flow field given by
\begin{equation*}
	\overline{v} = 
	\dfrac{\displaystyle \iint_\Omega \norm{\vb{v}} \dd{x} \dd{y}}{\displaystyle \iint_\Omega 1 \dd{x} \dd{y}} = 
	\frac{1}{2 L^2}
	\iint_\Omega \sqrt{4 y^2 (1 - x^2)^2 + 4 x^2 (1 - y^2)^2} \dd{x} \dd{y}
\end{equation*}
could be chosen as a representative velocity. However, it is unclear whether or
not it is relevant for the behaviour of the solution. In view of the PDE from
\eqref{eq:smith_hutton_cauchy_problem}, it seems that the solution shall be
governed by the quotient $\rho / \Gamma$.
