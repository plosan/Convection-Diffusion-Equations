\subsection{Velocity field}

The velocity field for the Smith-Hutton case, given by $\vb{v} = 2 y (1 - x^2) \vb{i} - 2 x (1 - y^2) \vb{j}$ verifies the incompressibility condition since $\div{\vb{v}} = 0$. The stream function associated to $\vb{v}$ is $\psi(x,y) = -(1-x^2)(1-y^2)$. Recall that the streamlines are defined to be the curves $C \subset \Omega$ tangent to the vector field $\vb{v}$ at each point. If the streamlines are given by $h \colon I \subset \real \to \Omega$, $t \mapsto h(t) = (x(t), y(t))$, these satisfy
\begin{equation}
	\left\{
	\begin{aligned}
		\dot{x} &= 2 y (1 - x^2) \\
		\dot{y} &= - 2 x (1 - y^2)
	\end{aligned}
	\right.
\end{equation}
Define $f \colon \Omega \rightarrow \real^2$ by $f(x,y) = (2y(1 - x^2), -2x(1 - y^2))$. Since the stream lines must fill $\Omega$


For the purpose of visualization, the velocity field norm and direction is shown in figure \ref{fig:smith_hutton_velocity_field}.
